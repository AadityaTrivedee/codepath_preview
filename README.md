Iâ€™d like to build an app called SmartTrading. It is an educational app that teaches beginners how to trade stocks. Users can start with a virtual portfolio and make trades in real-time using live market data. The app includes lessons on topics like how the stock market works, reading charts, and managing risk. Features would include simulated trading, progress tracking, quizzes, and challenges (like Grow your portfolio 10% in 1 week). There could also be a leaderboard.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
